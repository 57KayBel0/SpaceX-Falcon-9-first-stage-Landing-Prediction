Lab 1: Collecting the data
Estimated time needed: 45 minutes

In this capstone, I predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore  I've determined if the first stage will land, I  determined the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In the lab, I  collected and made sure the data is in the correct format from an API. The following is an example of a successful and launch.

Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:

Most unsuccessful landings are planned. Space X performs a controlled landing in the oceans.

Objectives
In this lab, I made a get request to the SpaceX API. I also did some basic data wrangling and formating.

Requested  the SpaceX API
Cleaned the requested data
